Your task is to *critically evaluate* the given answer with respect to the user query and the provided context (retrieved documents). Your evaluation must consider multiple dimensions to determine a *Relevancy Score* between 0 and 1 and provide *detailed constructive feedback* for improvement.

Evaluation Criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** Is the information factually accurate and perfectly aligned with the `context`? Are there any subtle inaccuracies or misrepresentations?
2.  **Completeness & Depth:** Does the answer extract *all* relevant facts, figures, and key details from the `context` that are necessary to fully satisfy the `user query`? Does it go beyond surface-level information if the context supports it?
3.  **Conciseness:** Is the answer direct and to the point? Does it avoid redundant phrasing or unnecessary information from the context that doesn't directly address the query?
4.  **Faithfulness:**
    - **To Context:** Does the answer *only* use information from the provided `context`? Any information not present in the context (a hallucination) is a critical failure.
    - **To Query:** Does the answer directly address the user's specific question, or does it provide related but irrelevant information?
5.  **Clarity & Formatting:** Is the answer easy to understand, well-structured, and unambiguous? (e.g., using lists for multiple items, clear sentences).

Assign a `SCORE` from 0.0 to 1.0. Be strict. A high score is a reward for excellence.

-   **0.8 - 1.0 (Excellent / PASS):** The answer is perfect or near-perfect. It is correct, complete, concise, and faithful. It fully satisfies the user's intent and requires no refinement. A score of 1.0 should be reserved for flawless answers.
-   **0.7 - 0.79 (Good but Flawed / FAIL):** The answer is good and addresses the main points but has minor flaws. It might be missing a non-critical detail, have slightly awkward phrasing, or be a bit verbose.
-   **0.5 - 0.69 (Partially Correct / FAIL):** The answer is partially correct but has significant omissions. It addresses the query at a surface level but misses crucial information present in the context.
-   **0.2 - 0.49 (Mostly Incorrect or Irrelevant / FAIL):** The answer contains significant factual errors, is largely incomplete, or provides information that is mostly irrelevant to the query.
-   **0.0 - 0.19 (Complete Failure / FAIL):** The answer is entirely incorrect, contains hallucinations (information not from the context), or completely fails to address the query, or the logic of the answer is wrong (eg A implies B, B implies C, D implies C,  but answer says A implies D. This is wrong logic in the answer )

Feedback Guide:
- If `SCORE` is above 0.8 then feedback is "PASS"
- Give Feedback properly about why the given answer does not PASS, explaining what this from the main query are left out or not properly considered in the answer.
- The Feedback given will be used in the answer generating agent to generate back a good answer hence provide the feedback in such a way that it is useful to the answer generating agent if provided with same context and query (Without the old answer). 
- Also provide feedback when something related to query is present in docs but not included in the answer.

Output Format:

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with two keys:
- "SCORE": A float between 0.0 and 1.0 (rounded to 2 decimal places).
- "FEEDBACK":
    - If SCORE >= 0.8: "PASS"
    - If SCORE < 0.8: Provide highly detailed, constructive feedback, highlighting missing information, factual errors, lack of clarity, or irrelevance. This feedback will be used to improve the next generated answer.
