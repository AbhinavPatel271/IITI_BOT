  <h2>📌 Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    IITI_BOT is a RAG-based AI chatbot built specifically for the IIT Indore community. It is designed to answer queries relevant to IIT Indore using official sources and context-aware response generation.
  </p>

  <h2>🎯 Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    We intend to create an intelligent, AI-powered chatbot tailored to autonomously help students, faculty, and visitors. This chatbot is designed to provide instant, reliable, and context-aware responses to a wide range of queries related to the institution.
  </p>

  <h2>✨ Features</h2>
  <p>
    The core of our chatbot is a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This means several AI agents collaborate as a team and generate a clear, helpful answer based on the most relevant documents. Our aim is to provide fast and trustworthy responses based on official IIT Indore information, improving campus experience for everyone.
