    <em>WARNING ⚠️: The chatbot may take 8-10 minutes to generate responses if the backend server or docstore server (deployed on Render) is in a cold start state.
    It may also fail to respond due to "Pathway effect" which states that pathway can crash anytime without any changes in the previously working code. It is advisable to run the project locally.</em>

  <h2>📌 Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    IITI_BOT is a RAG-based AI chatbot built specifically for the IIT Indore community. It is designed to answer queries relevant to IIT Indore using official sources and context-aware response generation.
  </p>

  <h2>🎯 Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    We intend to create an intelligent, AI-powered chatbot tailored to autonomously help students, faculty, and visitors. This chatbot is designed to provide instant, reliable, and context-aware responses to a wide range of queries related to the institution.
  </p>

  <h2>✨ Features</h2>
  <p>
    The core of our chatbot is a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This means several AI agents collaborate as a team and generate a clear, helpful answer based on the most relevant documents. Our aim is to provide fast and trustworthy responses based on official IIT Indore information, improving campus experience for everyone.
